The goal is to build a data structure for a decomposition of the plane that supports to locate the face containing a given point.

The running program should support the following operations.

Read a DCEL from a file (constructed in Project 1) representing a decomposition of the plane.
Input a query point interactively by using the mouse, and highlighting the face containing the query point.
A running program implementing one of the planar point location data structures in [BKOS, Chapter 6] or [ST86](ST86.md) is expected.
